All of our apis are standard REST apis that just require keys, no oauth shenanigans are going on.
the three keys in this get data for the news, weather, and stocks:
    -news is the main attraction for our website and the core of our site, the newsapi gets all the articles we serve on our site
    -the stock api and weather api are more periphery, providing extra information about the day our users might want to know about.
    -news is pulled once a day at the start of the day, both weather and stocks are grabbed by the api directly whenever they are needed.
